    'about_main' => 'samelectronics is an experimental interdisciplinary art project coming from the novgorod republic. founded in 2016 in one of the sleeping areas of novgorod as a purely musical project, today samelectronics has expanded its boundaries and is engaged in the exploration and transformation of reality and simulacra through the prism of music, sound art, video art, glitch art and other forms of media art.',
    'key_aspect'=> 'A key aspect of our work is the use of artificial intelligence, which allows us to transmit experimental dreams and daydreams in a form previously inaccessible to the human imagination. we are riders of the metamodern, standing at the intersection of technology and art, convinced that neural networks not only do not harm art, but also reveal new sides of it, expanding the horizons of perception. in each work we strive for a symbiosis between analog and digital, past and future, real and illusory, in order to redefine the boundaries of the human experience in the post-truth era.'
